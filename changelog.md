* Adjusted inner attachment node on conical/petal bay to be offset inward like new stock settings on cargo bays.
* Updated all engines/SRBs to use FXModuleAnimateThrottle for heat animation.
* Updated all engines/SRBs to use new standard thermal settings, and new career contract constraints.

* Rebalanced the weight ratios of all SRBs, to correspond to KSP 1.0.X balance:
  * Increased dry mass (did not alter propellant amounts, ISPs, thrust values, etc).
  * Wet/Dry mass ratio is on sliding scale. Larger & more advanced SRBs have better mass ratios.
* Removed stripes from procedural fairings (will affect SpaceY Expanded as well).
* Slightly improved the texture rendering for the 5m fueled nose cone in the VAB menus.

* LFO engines will now animate their heat glow based on throttle (like "Better Emissives" patch) instead of temperature.
  * I've been debating this one for a while. We'll try this out and see how it goes.
  * It's contained in patch called "SpaceY_HeatAnimation.cfg". Delete it or rename the "cfg" part to disable.
  * Patch will also apply to SpaceY-Expanded engines.
* New default custom flame/particle effects for all LFO (K,M,R series) engines. 
* New engine bell art assets for the M,R series of LFO engines.

* With InterstellarFuelSwitch or Firespitter, stack attachment bases can be toggled on K1,M1,R1 engines.
* Improved labeling on shrouds for K1,M1,R1 engines.
