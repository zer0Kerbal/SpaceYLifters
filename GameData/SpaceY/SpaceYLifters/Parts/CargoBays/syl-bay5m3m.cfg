	description = Explore space in the Saturn-V style! A conical payload bay with functional doors. IMPORTANT NOTES: If you are going to place an engine above the fairing (Apollo-style), you MUST use a STACK SEPARATOR. Using a stack decoupler instead will leave the decouper stuck to where the doors close, and will block access to your payload. ALSO: Don't forget a docking port or decoupler for the payload!
